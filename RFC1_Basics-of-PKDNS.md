# RFC1: Basics of PKDNS

There exists a decentralized platform for retrieving domain names using public keys. These public key domain names can hold public values using a DHT key/value store. They also can be used for other future objectives. They remain decentralized with no central authority.

In this system, there exists:

* A Decentralized Node Service
* A Decentralized DHT
* Relay Nodes
* Registar Services
* Address Translation by Pivot (RFC#2)
* Multiple Protocol Support (RFC#5) For PKDNS
* A CLI For Interface (RFC#3)
* Potential Monetary Exchanges Using Block Lattices (BL_RFC#1)

## Connections

1. RPC
2. HTTP/HTTPS
3. WSS
